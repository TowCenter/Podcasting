A Post-Script to *A Guide to the Business of Podcasting*
 ========================================================
 
 The podcasting field advances at a rapid pace. Indeed, even in the six weeks since this report was submitted for final edits, there have been several major developments. The following three are of greatest significance to my research: 

 -   the imminent inclusion of podcasts on Google Play; 

 -   the success of “The Message,” a podcast produced by General Electric     for Panoply; 

 -   the conclusion of PRX’s latest fundraising campaign for their     podcast collective Radiotopia.
