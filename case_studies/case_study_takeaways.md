Case Study Takeaways
 --------------------
 
 Outlined below are a number of key takeaways, gathered from across the above case studies, addressing four critical areas for podcasting: advertising, audience engagement, diverse revenue streams, and networks. 

 <b>Advertising</b> 

 -   When a podcast’s numbers reach critical mass, a show can develop     direct relationships with advertisers (and keep 100 percent of the     revenue). 

 -   A strong brand identity can ensure advertiser interest. 

 -   CPMs remain malleable, especially when the advertising content is     bespoke. CPMs need not be the only method of earning advertising     revenue. 

 -   Podcasting offers ways of experimenting with advertising and an     opportunity to stand out from the online/mobile advertising sphere. 

 -   Journalists must exercise caution when choosing sponsors if they are     to maintain credibility. It’s possible to establish a line between     editorial and advertorial, though ad quality may be sacrificed. 

 <b>Audience Engagement</b> 

 -   Podcasts can allow you to own a relationship with your audience and     engage with listeners directly. 

 -   Engaged, loyal audiences are more likely to support freemium models. 

 -   Podcasts can be used to diversify content, providing another     platform for reaching your consumer. 

 -   Podcasts can add value to online audiences and brands. 

 -   Live shows can be used to build audience/host community. 

 <b>Diverse Revenue Streams</b> 

 -   Podcasts can offer a way to diversify revenue streams, including     direct support from audiences and subscription models that offer     premium content. 

 -   Branded content could be a viable way of earning advertising revenue     beyond CPMs. 

 <b>Networks</b> 

 -   Audience growth remains a significant challenge, one which networks     can help shows to overcome. 

 -   If networks are to maintain talent, they must super-serve their     creators. 

 -   Outlets can tap internal talent as a way of creating new content. 

 -   For publishers (particularly big name publishers) interested in     producing podcasts, Panoply offers an interesting, low-risk way to     enter the space.
