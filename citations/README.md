 <sup><a href="../footnotes/README.html">i</a></sup>
     Source](http://radioopensource.org/about/), is often credited as the     first podcast (and his 2003 interview with Winer <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/lydondev/2003/07/09/spoken-word-a-few-good-bloggers/">the first podcast     episode</a>),     this claim is arguable as it depends upon one’s definition of     podcasting. I have called “Daily Source Code” the first podcast     because Curry’s show included the software script that allowed for     audio transfer to an mp3 device (which I am asserting is part of the     definition of a podcast); Lydon’s audioblog, while it included the     enclosure that allowed for audio to be accessed via RSS, did not     initially include this script. 

 <sup><a href="../footnotes/README.html">ii</a></sup>
 

 <sup><a href="../footnotes/README.html">iii</a></sup>
     report originally stated Christopher Lydon was the first podcaster,     it has been updated with more information regarding the     technological definition of podcasting (see footnote 1). The change     is not just technical; because Christopher Lydon was a professional     radio journalist before he was a podcaster, attributing podcasting’s     beginnings to him fosters a narrative that podcasting has grown from     radio. In fact, many other podcasts emerged around the same time as     Lydon’s and Curry’s, and most were by non-radio professionals.     <sup><a href=../citations/index.html>168</a></sup>
