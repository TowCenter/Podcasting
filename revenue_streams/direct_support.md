Direct Support
 --------------
 
 From the beginning, podcasts have leveraged their direct audience relationships by asking for listener support via donations or pledges. Taking a cue from public radio, the Maximum Fun network does <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/donate">yearly pledge drives and has a tiered membership model, for example</a>. 

 Jake Shapiro foresees direct support happening in innovative ways in the future, as PRX (and podcasts in general) seeks to convert “passionate fan support into a more sustained way of long-term contributing.”<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>75</a></sup> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a>, a site that allows consumers to regularly support creators, has become a popular option for many podcasters. Although not meant for listener donations per se, the *StartUp* <a href="http://www.wearehearken.com">Hearken</a> provides media outlets with <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/7/27/curious-city-inspires-scalable-model-engagement-journalism-answers-peoples-questions/">listener support modules that allow listeners to engage with the creation process from inception to publication</a> (which could potentially make listeners more amenable to contributing financially). Kickstarter has been used to fund specific goals around launching new podcasts or funding new seasons, as well. <a href="http://radioambulante.org">Radio Ambulante</a> was one of the first to have success with Kickstarter; in early 2012, about a year into the project, it <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1255653356/radio-ambulante/description">raised 46,032 dollars</a> (just over its 40,000-dollar goal).<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>76</a></sup> 

 PRX has also seen marked success with Kickstarter campaigns. In August of 2012, Roman Mars hoped to earn 42,000 dollars for the third season of his popular show 99% Invisible, distributed by PRX. He used both challenge grants and stretch goals to incentivize donors. In the end, he <a href="http://current.org/2012/08/podcast-with-limited-radio-airplay-sets-kickstarter-record/">raised over 170,000 dollars</a>.<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>77</a></sup> In November of 2014, PRX and Mars turned again to Kickstarter to fund their podcast collective/network Radiotopia, hoping to raise 250,000 dollars. They <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/11/14/radiotopia-sets-record-for-publishing-and-radio-funding-on-kickstarter/">raised 620,412 dollars</a> and became the most-funded radio/podcast project in Kickstarter history.<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>78</a></sup> 

 However, while Kickstarter is a tremendous opportunity to raise both funds and media attention, it’s by no means a sure bet. A brief glance at the Kickstarter audio and radio/podcast pages shows dozens of Kickstarter ventures that failed to attain their goals. A successful Kickstarter campaign requires strategic and time-intensive marketing initiatives.
