Foundation Support
 ------------------
 
 Not-for-profit podcasts in particular have found success in cultivating grants from foundations that align with the podcastâ€™s content or mission. For example, Radiotopia was awarded a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/05/knight-foundation-invests-1-million-in-creator-driven-podcast-collective-radiotopia/">one-million-dollar grant from the Knight Foundation</a> in May to develop new shows and reach new audiences.<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>79</a></sup> Of course, grant money often comes with strings attached; foundations generally give money on the condition that content producers cover certain topics/issues.
