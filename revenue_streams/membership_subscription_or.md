Membership, Subscription, or Premium Models
 -------------------------------------------
 
 Many podcasts and podcast networks—including Gimlet Media and Midroll Media—have recently rolled out subscription or premium models, in which paying subscribers receive extra perks (such as limited ads, bonus episodes, archival episodes, early access to live events or content, members-only content, etc.). Almost all of these shows and networks continue to offer their regular shows for free (with ads included of course). The only audio company that is entirely subscription-based is Audible, which will <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-makes-moves-into-original-podcasting-hires-npr-vp-of-programming/">soon offer access to original audio content</a> to its paying subscribers (and to paying subscribers only).<sup><a href=../citations/index.html>80</a></sup>
